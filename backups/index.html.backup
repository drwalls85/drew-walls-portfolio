            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My journey began at Walmart during their bold pivot to customer-centric branding—chasing Amazon and reimagining stores as experiences. This sparked a thrilling journey through agencies and SaaS, where I've pioneered ideas that blend tech, partnerships, and CX to create real impact.</p>
            <p>From inventing DMaaS to self-teaching 3D modeling, I've turned strategic visions into executable growth for Fortune 100 clients like Walmart, Amazon, and Teleperformance.</p>
            <p>Throughout, I've lived by the mantra: Start with CX and work backwards—delivering sustained growth, client retention, and market disruption.</p>
